1. What is GUI?
=======================================================================================================
        Short for graphical user interface, a GUI is an interface that uses icons or other visual indicators 
to interact with electronic devices, rather than only text via a command line.
        Graphical User Interface (GUI) offers user interaction via some graphical components. 
For example our underlying Operating System also offers GUI via window,frame,Panel, Button, 
Textfield, TextArea, Listbox, Combobox, Label, Checkbox etc. These all are known as components. 
Using these components we can create an interactive user interface for an application.
        GUI provides result to end user in response to raised events.GUI is entirely based events. 
For example clicking over a button, closing a window, opening a window, typing something in a 
textarea etc. These activities are known as events.GUI makes it easier for the end user to use an 
application. It also makes them interesting.

GUI => Graphical user interface
CUI => Character user interface

2. Examples of GUI based Applications
=======================================================================================================
1. Automated Teller Machine (ATM)
2. Airline Ticketing System
3. Information Kiosks at railway stations
4. Mobile Applications
5. Navigation Systems

3. How to create GUI?
=======================================================================================================

        1. AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
                API to develop GUI or window based application in JAVA. AWT is thin layer of code on top of
                OS. Components of AWT are platform dependent. AWT is heavy weight, because components are using 
                the resources of OS. Using AWT you have to implement a lot of things yourself.
                PACKAGE => java.awt 
                Package Link => https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html
                CLASSES => Frame, TextField, Label, Button etc.

        2. Swing
                Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create 
                window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and 
                entirely written in java. Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight 
                components.
                PACKAGE => javax.swing 
                Package Link => https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html
                CLASSES => JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.

        What is API?
        ------------
                An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software 
        applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, 
        APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
                For example, In Object Oriented Design, code is organized into objects. Your application may have hundreds of objects 
        defined that can interact with one another. Each object has an API — a set of public methods and 
        properties that it uses to interact with other objects in your application. An object may also have 
        inner logic that is private, meaning that it’s hidden from the outside scope (and not an API).

        What is JFC?
        -----------
        The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are a set of GUI components which simplify the development of 
        desktop applications. API's available in JFC are Swing, JAVA 2d, Accessibility and Drag & Drop.

        Every user interface considers the following three main aspects −
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        1. UI Elements
                These are the core visual elements the user eventually sees and interacts with. 
        GWT provides a huge list of widely used and common elements varying from basic to complex, 
        which we will cover in this tutorial.
        2. Layouts 
                They define how UI elements should be organized on the screen and provide a final look 
        and feel to the GUI (Graphical User Interface). This part will be covered in the Layout chapter.
        3. Behavior
                These are the events which occur when the user interacts with UI elements. 
        This part will be covered in the Event Handling chapter.

4. Basic Terminologies
=======================================================================================================
1. Component	
        Component is an object having a graphical representation that can be displayed on the screen 
        and that can interact with the user. For examples buttons, checkboxes, list and scrollbars of a 
        graphical user interface.
2. Container	
        Container object is a component that can contain other components.Components added to a container 
        are tracked in a list. The order of the list will define the components' front-to-back stacking 
        order within the container. If no index is specified when adding a component to a container, 
        it will be added to the end of the list.
3. Panel	
        Panel provides space in which an application can attach any other components, including other 
        panels.
4. Window	
        Window is a rectangular area which is displayed on the screen. In different window we can execute 
        different program and display different data. Window provide us with multitasking environment. 
        A window must have either a frame, dialog, or another window defined as its owner when it's constructed.
5. Frame	
        A Frame is a top-level window with a title and a border. The size of the frame includes any area 
        designated for the border. Frame encapsulates window. It and has a title bar, menu bar, borders, 
        and resizing corners.
6. Canvas	
        Canvas component represents a blank rectangular area of the screen onto which the application can 
        draw. Application can also trap input events from the use from that blank area of Canvas component.
